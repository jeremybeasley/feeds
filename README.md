### Design 
Self-explanatory. Podcast cover a range of sub-disciplines in design focusing on information design (data vis) and digital product design. Side note, I've cycled through a ton of design podcasts and the SNR feels too low for me. Podcasts that dig deep through someone's body of work is . Those that focus a ton of casual chit-chat are hit-or-miss for me based on the interviewer style and the personality of the interviewee.

### Dev
Podcasts that get into the weeds of specific tech. Note, I struggle with this category of podcasts. Given how code-oriented the content for this category can be, I'm not sure the medium (audio) does it much favors. Video podcasts may be a better choice.
